        <div className="text-xl font-light space-y-5 mt-5">
          <p>Ensuring the privacy of our users is the only way we can continue to provide this service.</p>
          <p>We will not rent/sell/release any information to any third party.</p>
          <p>Any information you provide will not be provided to any third-party in any situation, unless you a) publish a listing (the listing information becomes public) or b) send a message (the content, email and/or phone number are sent in an email to the recipient) or b) make a review (the content is public if approved and is linked to you profile which may display information like your favourites; check your profile in this case).</p>
          <p>We implemented HTTPS (the thing which means no-one can see what you are sending back and forwards from the site) in 2013, many sites (normal and adult) are only doing that today.</p>
          <p>We run a security programme which a) implements regular updates to servers, frameworks and software compenents and b) works to automatically and manually identify threat and instrusion attempts.</p>
          <p>If we receive a valid legal request for information from a law enforcement agency, only the information which can be directly linked to the request will be released. We will refuse any requests for 'general information', even if made legally.</p>
          <p>We do not process or retain any credit card details, we use a third-party processor in all cases. Using external payment processing means we can select partners who deal with tens/hundreds of thousands of payments on a weekly basis and maintain bank-level security teams to protect customer data.</p>
